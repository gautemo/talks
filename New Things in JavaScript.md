## Description
JavaScript is the most used programming language! It's coming with improvements and features which makes life easier each year.
I'll go through what's new in ES6, ES7, and ES8. This is for you that wants to improve in JavaScript and keep updated with writing modern JavaScript.

Lean back and watch live coding and code samples, this talk is for the ones who have done a little JavaScript and the more experienced
that doesn't have the latest syntax and functionality in their fingertips yet.
