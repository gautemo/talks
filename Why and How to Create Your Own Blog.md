## Private notes ü§´

What's your motivation for blogging?:  
I already write some blogs at https://gaute.dev/dev-blog and https://dev.to/gautemeekolsen
- You will get a better understanding of the topic yourself.  
- You can get feedback from the community. I learn when others comment on the articles. 
- You have documented something so you can easily look back and remember how it was.  
- I create a "brand" for myself and promote yourself as a skilled person.  
- You will contribute to the community. Helping others feel good.  

What to write about:
- What you are good at
- Learnings from your own projects, both work and side projects
- Breaking news
- Mix it up with some short Today I Learned blogs

You should write about both easy and hard stuff. Easy stuff will show others how easy it can be, which you probably don't know until you have done it or are good at it. Hard stuff will help others that are stuck.

Important things:
- Editor
- Code blocks - syntax highlighting
- Demo sections
