### Description
Serverless functions are functions you write and deploy to a cloud provider.
In this presentation I give an overview of what a serverless function is, what they can do and give an comparison
of the three big cloud providers Amazon with AWS Lambda, Microsoft with Azure Functions and Google with Firebase Functions.
Afterwards I give a demo of how you can implement firebase functions to save your project.
